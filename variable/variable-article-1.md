### On variables and their many names in Java and programming at large

When you are just getting started as a programmer, there are many things you encounter 
that don't make total sense, initially. You hear your teammates using the words variable 
and value interchangeably. You see same variable being declaring in different places, and 
then you need to call it local, or static, or that thingy that stores that thing... Uhhh...

On top of that, we now have lombok, which allows us to simplify our code even more, and 
reduce the definition of our variable to var, or val, or... wait, which one is which, again?

Oh, right. Not to forget that if we work in Spring Framework, our Java code becomes really 
not that Java-ish. We have annotations! Here is one of them - @Value
